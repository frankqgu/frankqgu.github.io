## About
I'm a current second year student with an interest in software developements and managing data. I love creating ideas and making models with visualization to better understand topics. I'm proficient in many popular libraries and frameworks including React, NodeJS, Django, Flask, FastAPI and more. Throughout my time I've worked on multiple community based projects as well as personal side projects, such as Landing pages, Widgets, Extensions, and Video Game Services. In my free time, I love watching our Husky's basketball team and practicing my jumpers in the gym. I also digitally draw rkgk here and there ^_^
