- My name is Qingyang, but I go by Frank! I am a freshman majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at University of Connecticut. 

## About
My interests are in Machine Learning and its applications in Consumer IoT. My current studies focuses on artificial intelligence and data science. During my free time, I like to explore and improve on skills like web development and content creation. I value myself as ambitious, resilient, and efficacious. I started coding around 9 in local library computers and quickly transitioned from scratch to languages like Python and Java. I found myself making scripts and modding to make quality-of-life changes. Now, I look to use my expertise and experience to improve businesses and communities.
