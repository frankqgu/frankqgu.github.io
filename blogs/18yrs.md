> Philosophy：efficiency and efficacy




<br>I remember anxiously counting down to the day of my 18th birthday. 18 years on this earth is absolutely an accomplishment, so is 19, so is 20. Thus, the reason really isn't to celebrate that day. It was more of a desire to understand **What's behind this unfamiliar yet important number？**

<br>My first interest in this number was around *15*. When I made my first checking bank account. I remember I was so excited to use my card, just to find out many of the products requires the user to be 18 years old. I couldn't sign up to paypal to send money, nor could I sign up for entertainment subsciptions. <br>
Fast foward to when I was *16*, I learned about more restrictions around the magic number. My drivers permits came with special requirements due to being underage. I couldn't make a brokerage account to trade. <br>
*17* is when I was educated on most of my fiancial knowledge. looking at all the online resources, it made me ambitious to start my personal fiance.
Perhaps I was too rushed to start growing up. I know people always reminences about their childhood days. **But until I get it, how could I know?**. I want to know. I want to be aware and filled with knowledge. If that's the trade off with being an adult, then I'll be happy to make that trade.

## Money

The first thing I did on the night of  my birthday was to instantly sign up for a **credit card** I've been eyeing at. It was nothing special, just a secured student card that doesn't contain any features. But I found out during my reaseach that *Credit* and *Credit Cards* have an interesting unspoken <u>Catch-22 Dynamic.</u> It goes like so:

##### Credit Card:

- Requires **Credit** to get a good *Credit Card*
- Can only start at 18
- Spends money on the *Credit Card* to gain **Credit**

##### Credit:

- Requires *Credit Card* to start gaining **Credit**
- Can only start at 18
- Other methods of building credit are possible, such as student loan (needs to graduate first) or car bills (needs to own insurance)((Insurance is credit-based))

## Content Creation

Since young, I've been invested with **Motion Editing** and **Digital Photography**. I've considered commiting my interest into this field, but I feel like it's work requires a heavy amount of subjectivness and personality more than anything. However, I look to solve objective problems. I feel that my energy can be more effiecently used in a STEM field rather than an artistic field. I've recieved awards and honors from many different art classes and historically excelled in them. *Yet*, I think I was more towards my hard working trait that I can really look to go beyond the expectations and create something innovative and new. Which links me back to programming, where I feel like I can go as deep as I can and still produce amazing results.

### Graphics Designing

Graphics designing have seriously put in work. I realized how much I can utilize my knowledge in **Adobe Suite** and easily create amazing *Presentations* and *Posters*. So far, I've created:

- Quarterly Infographics for World Language
- Logos and Branding for peers
- Commissions for teachers and district
- Informative Videos and PSA for school events

I was able to contribute to a lot to the student life and community off some skills I learned by myself, it felt really good and authentic. I wish to continue doing this with whatever skill I may obtain in the future.

**It seems that the twists and turns I've encountered in the past have all been arranged appropriately and reasonably now. Maybe it's not right, maybe it's not satisfactory, or it's meant to dissatisify. But looking back, it seems that I also encountered more happiness and a broader future.**

To be or not to be. The question of life

##### Why do I strive to live, while facing unreasonable walls around me? Perhaps I will asnwer that soon. Let's see.
